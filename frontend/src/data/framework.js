Under one product organization, Cisco's breadth becomes its greatest differentiator — it's no longer about deploying product features, it's about delivering real business outcomes. You do that with platforms, not products. Tokens per dollar per hour is the new currency of global competitiveness, and Cisco provides the full stack from silicon to software to make that economy work.",
